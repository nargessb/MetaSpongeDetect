# MetaSpongeDetect
MetaSpongeDetect is a meta-learning–based framework for detecting sponge attacks, feature-collision poisoning, and other training-time manipulations in deep neural networks.
The method learns cross-scenario temporal patterns of instability rather than dataset-specific or architecture-specific cues, enabling generalization across models, datasets, and attack configurations.
